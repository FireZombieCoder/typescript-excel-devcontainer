# DevContainer Build Fix

## Issue Resolved

The DevContainer was failing to build due to non-existent npm packages in the Dockerfile. The error was:

```
npm error 404 Not Found - GET https://registry.npmjs.org/office-js-helpers - Not found
```

## Root Cause

The `.devcontainer/Dockerfile` was trying to install packages that don't exist in the npm registry:
- `office-js-helpers` - This package doesn't exist
- Various `office-addin-*` packages - These packages don't exist

## Fix Applied

1. **Removed non-existent packages** from the Dockerfile:
   - Removed `office-js-helpers`
   - Removed all `office-addin-*` packages
   - Kept only packages that actually exist in npm registry

2. **Updated .gitignore**:
   - Removed `.devcontainer/` from gitignore
   - Now DevContainer configuration files are tracked in git

3. **Simplified package installation**:
   - Only install packages that are verified to exist
   - Use `@microsoft/office-js` instead of non-existent packages

## Current Dockerfile

The DevContainer Dockerfile now installs only verified packages:

```dockerfile
# Install global Node.js tools for Office development
RUN npm install -g \
    typescript \
    ts-node \
    @types/node \
    eslint \
    prettier \
    webpack \
    webpack-cli \
    rollup \
    jest \
    @playwright/test \
    yo \
    generator-office

# Install Office.js types and tools globally
RUN npm install -g \
    @types/office-js \
    @types/office-runtime
```

## How to Rebuild DevContainer

### In Gitpod (Current Environment)
```bash
# Rebuild the DevContainer
gitpod environment devcontainer rebuild
```

### In VS Code (Local Development)
1. Open Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P` or `Cmd+Shift+P`)
2. Run "Dev Containers: Rebuild Container"
3. Wait for the build to complete

## Verification

After rebuilding, you can verify the DevContainer is working by:

1. **Check Node.js installation**:
   ```bash
   node --version
   npm --version
   ```

2. **Check TypeScript installation**:
   ```bash
   tsc --version
   ```

3. **Check project dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   npm run build:dev
   ```

4. **Run validation script**:
   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-devcontainer.sh
   ```

## Expected Results

- ✅ DevContainer builds successfully
- ✅ All dependencies install without errors
- ✅ Build process works correctly
- ✅ Development environment is fully functional

## Next Steps

1. **Rebuild the DevContainer** using the commands above
2. **Test the development environment** to ensure everything works
3. **Start developing** your Excel Add-ins with the fully configured environment

The DevContainer should now build successfully and provide a complete TypeScript Excel development environment!
