# Product for Everyone


## What it is 
---

I wanted to create a product that educated novices, while also making them not 
give up at whatever amazing idea they had.

As a finance/it professional, I suffered through endless hidden markov chains
... wasted hours deleting cache files that built up while i was learning
and wasted so much time because of fundamental gaps in knowledge or skill
that prevented me from accomplishing some task

Context switching is very bad for computers, its even worse for humans.

While I understand that there are an infinite number of tools available and
every tool has its own super power and what it is good at, the fact of the matter
is that we don't have the time to explore every tool.

I made a mistake when i decided to completly abandon a software tool i had become
an expert in.

It is easier to learn a new tool, when you cam relate the tool to your existign expert
tool you use.  

This is why we are creating the excel typescript web application function visualization and
builder tool to help problem solve.
