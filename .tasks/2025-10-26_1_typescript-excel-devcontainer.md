# Task Description

Create a comprehensive, reusable devcontainer specifically designed for TypeScript development focused on Microsoft Excel applications. This devcontainer will serve as a base layer for building:

- Excel function builder helpers
- Games in Excel (using Office.js)
- Office Add-ins and extensions
- Excel automation tools
- Data visualization components for Excel
- Custom Excel solutions and utilities

The devcontainer should be modular and extensible, allowing for gradual complexity addition as project ideas grow. It should include all necessary tools, extensions, and configurations for modern TypeScript development with Excel/Office integration.

# Project Overview

This project aims to create a standardized development environment for TypeScript-based Excel applications. The devcontainer will provide:

- Complete TypeScript development stack
- Office.js SDK and related tools
- Excel-specific development tools and extensions
- Testing frameworks for Office applications
- Build tools and bundlers optimized for Office Add-ins
- Debugging capabilities for Excel integration
- Sample projects and templates
- Documentation and best practices

The environment should be production-ready and follow modern development practices while being easily extensible for future project requirements.

# Original Execution Protocol

```
# Execution Protocol:

## 1. Git Branch Creation
1. Create a new task branch from [MAIN BRANCH]:
```
# Always use the current system date (ISO 8601)
TASK_DATE="$(date +%Y-%m-%d)"
git checkout -b "task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_${TASK_DATE}" [MAIN BRANCH]
```
2. Add the branch name to the [TASK FILE] under "Task Branch."
3. Verify the branch is active:
```
git branch --show-current
```
1.1. Find out the core files and implementation details involved in the [TASK].
- Store what you've found under the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
1.2. Branch out
- Analyze what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
- Look at other files and functionality related to what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree", by looking at even more details, be thorough and take your time.

## 2. Task File Creation
1. Create the [TASK FILE], naming it `[TASK_FILE_NAME]_[TASK_IDENTIFIER].md` and place it in the `.tasks` directory at the root of the project.
2. The [TASK FILE] should be implemented strictly using the "Task File Template" below, and also contain:
a. Accurately fill in the "Original Execution Protocol" and "Original Safety Procedures" by following the detailed descriptions outlined in each respective section.
b. Adjust the values of all placeholders based on the "User Input" and placeholder terminal commands.
3. Make a visible note in the [TASK FILE] that the "Execution Protocol" and "Safety Procedures" content should NEVER be removed or edited

<<< HALT IF NOT [Auto-Run]: Before continuing, wait for the user to confirm the name and contents of the [TASK FILE] >>>

## 3. Task Analysis
1. Examine the [TASK] by looking at related code and functionality step-by-step to get a birds eye view of everything. It is important that you do the following, in that specific order, one step at a time:
a. Find out the core files and implementation details involved in the [TASK].
- Store what you've found under the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
b. Branch out
- Analyze what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE].
- Look at other files and functionality related to what is currently in the "Task Analysis Tree", by looking at even more details, be thorough and take your time.
c. Repeat b until you have a full understanding of everything that might be involved in solving the task, then follow the below steps:
- Do NOT stop until you can't find any more details that might be relevant to the [TASK].
2. Double check everything you've entered in the "Task Analysis Tree" of the [TASK FILE]
- Look through everything in the "Task Analysis Tree" and make sure you weed out everything that is not essential for solving the [TASK].

<<< HALT IF NOT [Auto-Run]: Before continuing, wait for user confirmation that your analysis is satisfactory, if not, iterate on this >>>

## **4. Iterate on the Task**
1. Follow Safety Procedures section 1 before making any changes
2. Analyze code context fully before changes
3. Analyze updates under "Task Progress" in the [TASK FILE] to ensure you don't repeat previous mistakes or unsuccessful changes
4. Make changes to the codebase as needed
5. If errors occur, follow Safety Procedures section 2
6. For each change:
- Seek user confirmation on updates
- Mark changes as SUCCESSFUL/UNSUCCESSFUL
- ONLY after you or the user have tested and reviewed the result of the change.
- After successful changes, follow Safety Procedures section 3
- Optional, when appropriate (determined appropriate by you), commit code:
```
git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
```

<<< HALT IF NOT [Auto-Run]: Before continuing, confirm with the user if the changes where successful or not, if not, iterate on this execution step once more >>>

## **5. Task Completion**
1. After user confirmation, and if there are changes to commit:
- Stage all changes EXCEPT the task file:
```
git add --all -- ':!./.tasks'
```
- Commit changes with a concise message:
```
git commit -m "[COMMIT_MESSAGE]"
```

<<< HALT IF NOT [Auto-Run]: Before continuing, ask the user if the [TASK BRANCH] should be merged into the [MAIN BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8 >>>

## **6. Merge Task Branch**
1. Confirm with the user before merging into [MAIN BRANCH].
2. If approved:
- Checkout [MAIN BRANCH]:
```
git checkout [MAIN BRANCH]
```
- Merge:
```
git merge -
```
3. Confirm that the merge was successful by running:
```
git log [TASK BRANCH]..[MAIN BRANCH] | cat
```

## **7. Delete Task Branch**
1. Ask the user if we should delete the [TASK BRANCH], if not, proceed to execution step 8
2. Delete the [TASK BRANCH]:
```
git branch -d "task/[TASK_IDENTIFIER]_[TASK_DATE]"
```

<<< HALT IF NOT [Auto-Run]: Before continuing, confirm with the user that the [TASK BRANCH] was deleted successfully by looking at `git branch --list | cat` >>>

## **8. Final Review**
1. Look at everything we've done and fill in the "Final Review" in the [TASK FILE].

<<< HALT IF NOT [Auto-Run]: Before we are done, give the user the final review >>>

## **Safety Procedures**
These procedures should be followed during all task execution steps:

1. Before Making Changes
1.1. Create backup of files to be modified:
```bash
cp [file_to_change] [file_to_change].backup
```
1.2. Document files being modified in Task Progress

2. If Errors Occur
2.1. Git-related issues:
- Merge conflicts:
```bash
git status # List conflicted files
git merge --abort # If resolution isn't possible
git reset --hard HEAD # Return to last commit if needed
```
- Failed commits:
```bash
git reset HEAD~1 # Undo last commit if needed
```

2.2. Code changes issues:
- Restore from backup:
```bash
cp [file_to_change].backup [file_to_change]
```
- Document failure in Task Progress
- Note specific error messages and conditions

3. After Successful Changes
3.1. Verify functionality:
- Run relevant tests if available
- Manual verification of changed functionality
3.2. Remove backup files if changes are successful:
```bash
rm [file_to_change].backup
```
3.3. Document success in Task Progress
```

**IMPORTANT NOTE**: The "Execution Protocol" and "Safety Procedures" content should NEVER be removed or edited from this task file.
